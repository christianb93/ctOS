 * This module contains a few mathematic functions, in particular basic routines to work with floating point numbers
 * 
 * Note that the algorithms used in this module are far from being optimal. In each individual case, there is probably
 * an algorithm which is faster, consumes less memory and is more precise. However, the purpose of this library is not to
 * provide a floating point library for scientific or productive use, but to educate me and allow me to try out a few different
 * approaches, like
 * - argument reduction
 * - iterative approaches
 * - bit fiddling
 * - approximation by polynomials
 * - use of a floating point unit
* Correspondingly the algorithms are chosen to be simply, readable and covering all these various aspects.

 * log_2(x_{n+1}) = 2 log_2(x_n) - a_n

 * log_2(x_n) = 1/2(log(x_{n+1}) + a_n) = 1/2 log_2(x_{n+1}) + 1/2 a_n

 * log_2(x) = 1/2 a_0 + 1/4 a_1 + 1/8 a_2 + ... + 1/2^n log_2(x_n)
